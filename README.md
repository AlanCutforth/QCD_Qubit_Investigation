# QCD_Qubit_Investigation
 
Code written for my Quantum Coherent Devices project investigating 3 and 4 Joesephson junction qubits.

qubit_main.py:
This code plots the qubit mesh and is capable of determining its stability with varying input parameters, and measuring for which parameters it remains in a stable two-minima configuration.

qubit_datafunctions.py:
Functions file employed by the main script.
